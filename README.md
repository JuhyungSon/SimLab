Make own Simlab

1.Create the Lobby Scene, Control Room Scene, Chemical Plant (Enginereing) Scene.

2.Open the game engine and paste the codes into the appropriate game scene.

3.Build your own engineering course in the scene.

4.Applied our code to the 3D object in Unity. 

# Get Started 
The code is a Unity project that includes a number of code examples. Download the codes and customize them for your own project.

# WorkFlow and Code Explanation 

- [Lobby Scene] 

- Button VR : Button VR is the function that activates the UI in the Lobby, Chemical Plant. I used this code to use the entire scenario. When the user interacts with this button, this code may be utilized in both the lobby scene and the chemical factory.
    
- Fade screen: The fade screen code ensures that when the user moves from the lobby scene to the control room, the user's camera fades for three seconds. The user can have a more immersive impression.

- Move Scene: The move scene code is in charge of transporting the character from one scene to another.

- Network Manager: Netwrok manager code is responsible for controlling the scene within the photon network. If the user enters the simlab, the scene may be produced using the photon network.

- Network Player: The job of the network player in code is to create the user utilizing the photon network. The user can communicate with other users using this code.

- NetworkPlayerSpawen: Network player spawn code is responsible for allowing the user to spawn in the scene.

- ProgressBar: It represent that the progress of the video lecture.

- Rotate: This code controls the rotation of the DC(Distialliation Column) in the center of the desk in the lobby scenario. The user may view the DC(Distialliation Column) from the lobby.  

- SceneTransitionManager: This code assists the user in moving from scene to scene.

- VideoPlayBack: This code is responsible for managing the video lecture from the lobby scene.

- [Control Room] 

- OperationModeButton: If the user wants to begin interacting with the operation protocol screen, this code will initiate the DC(Distialliation Column) protocols.

- [Chemical Plant] 


- HandleCheck, HandleChecker1,Handelcheckr2: If the user interacts with the valve, It can be tracked  how much the user tries to open the valve. 

- TimeChecker: This code provided some data for the accomplishment of user tasks.
